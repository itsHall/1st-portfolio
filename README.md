### Early 2017 - Web Design WVU
##### 960 Grid

After two initial projects using 960 grid, the final project of the semester was creating a portfolio site and indexing work.

I mainly keep this around as a glimpse back to where I started. It's also a way to show more work than I currently have on my portfolio website.
